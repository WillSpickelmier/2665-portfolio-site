           <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
           <p>Born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska I grew up playing sports. Hockey and baseball have always stood out (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hockeyislife" target="_blank">#HockeyIsLife</a>), but I played almost everything possible.</p>
           <p>I also grew up with a deep passion for media like music and television/movies. I couldn’t tell you what my favorite movie or TV genre is, I love all of them so much. My music interests spread very wide as well, but I tend to listen to rock and punk most often. </p>
